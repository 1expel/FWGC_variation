## FWGC 

On his way home, the farmer came to the bank of a river and rented a boat. But crossing the river by boat, the farmer could carry only himself and a single one of his purchases: the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage. If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage. How can the farmer, wolf, goat, and cabbage all get to the other side?

## Problem

As a wildfire rages through the grasslands, three lions and three wildebeest flee for their lives. To escape the inferno, they must cross over to the left bank of a crocodile-infested river. The boat can carry up to two animals at a time and it needs at least one lion or wildebeest on the boot to cross the river. lions can never outnumber the wildebeest on either side of the river. If the lions ever outnumbered the wildebeest on either side of the river, even for a moment, the lions would eat the wildebeest. Can you help them figure out how to get across on the one raft available without losing any lives?
